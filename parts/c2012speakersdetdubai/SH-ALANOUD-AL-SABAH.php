The west, for so long, has interpreted Arabian civilization in ways that do not truly reflect the essence of our ethnicity. What is lost in translation is out lasting ability to create marvelous works of art.

The materials used are key as they will comprise of Pearls, Gold Thread and Gold wires. Being the chief commodity for trade and the fuel to Kuwaiti economic established in the early stages of Kuwait civilization, pearls symbolize a crest of Kuwait’s customs and gold soon after became the highest commodity of trade from India, infusing our Jewelry with beautiful creations of Gold and Pearl.</p>
