Mapping, typically, a visual representation tool will be contested. We will find ways to symbolically depict and highlight the relationships between elements of space through non-visual maps. We will look to translate spatial experiences that are non- visual to non-visual representation.  How do you represent smell with abstracted smell? And how do you represent memory in this transient city? <br />
                      This workshop is open to writers, designers and artists or anyone who has an interest in the city.</p>
