                    <td><p>This Workshop will take the students through the  same design development  of an artisan, specifically that of a textile block printer. 
A mood board of images for design inspiration will be provided from which the participants will be asked to dissect potential patterns that they would like see transformed onto textile. They will then draw and trace, just as artisans do to produce a repeat pattern. 
As block printing in itself is an art studied by an artisan for years before it is perfected, this workshop will be producing the pattern in a collage form, which will then be transferred on to A2 sheets of paper. 
The intention of this workshop is to connect the participants with the artisan, demonstrating the amount of precision and skill needed to make what seems to be a simple, pattern based textile.  </p>
