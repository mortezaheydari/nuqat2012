  <tr>
    <td>Arch.Jassim Al Saddah is a graduate from the Architectural Assosciation(AA) in London whose experience in an architectural studio in London exposed him to a fuller scope on how to deal with clients, project development and design implementation. His passion for design in general transcends into multiple categories which include digital art, graphics, mixed media and interior design. Moreover, recycled design holds a greater appeal to Arc.Jasim due to its imported concept and how they are adapted and tweaked to "fit in" with local culture. This is interesting especially in a region where design was obsolete and comparatively indigenous only a mere 50 years ago.</td>
