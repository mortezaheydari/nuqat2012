    <p><strong>6. Order Confirmation</strong></p>
    <p>If you do not receive a confirmation email) after submitting payment  information, or if you experience an error message or service interruption  after submitting payment information, it is your responsibility to confirm with  the Company whether or not your order has been placed. Only you may be aware of  any problems that may occur during the purchase process. The Company will not  be responsible for losses (monetary or otherwise) if you assume that an order  was not placed because you failed to receive confirmation.</p>
    <p><strong>7. Convenience Charges and Order Processing Fees</strong></p>
    <p>Tickets purchased on nuqat.me are typically subject to a per ticket  convenience charge and a non-refundable per order processing fee valued at 3%  of the purchase amount. The 3% is inclusive within the total price and will not  be refunded in case the consumer asked for a refund.</p>
    <p><strong>8. Number of Tickets Per Customer or &quot;Ticket Limits&quot;</strong></p>
    <p>When purchasing tickets on nuqat.me, you are limited to one ticket per  transaction. This policy is in effect to discourage unfair ticket buying  practices.</p>
    <p><strong>9. Cancelled and Rescheduled Events</strong></p>
    <p>Occasionally, events, conferences, seminars and workshops are canceled  or rescheduled. Should this occur, we will attempt to contact you to inform you  of refund or exchange procedures for that specific activity. For exact  instructions on any canceled or rescheduled concert, please check the information  online or contact us.</p>
    <p>If your event was canceled, and you  already purchased your ticket, in most cases you won't need to do a thing.  We'll inform you of the cancellation and refund the amount you paid for your  tickets. If you bought your tickets on location, please return them at the same  location.</p>
    <p>If your event was rescheduled, we'll  contact you with the new date and time ASAP. In case you can't make it, you&rsquo;ll  be entitled for a refund. </p>
    <p><strong>10. Refunds and Exchanges</strong></p>
    <p>Before purchasing tickets, carefully review your event selection and  details.Â  Our policies generally prohibit  from issuing exchanges or refunds after a ticket has been purchased or for  lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed tickets. However, most tickets bought online  are fully refundable for 3 calendar days (72 hours) after you purchase them.  Tickets purchased at the event location must be returned or exchanged at the  same location; the event registration desk cannot exchange tickets bought  online. Exceptions to 3-day refund policies includeÂ  extreme cases whereas the Company will  evaluate on a case by case basis.</p>
    <p>You agree that you will not attempt to  evade, avoid, or circumvent any refund prohibitions in any manner with regard  to tickets you purchased. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you  will not contact seek a &quot;chargeback&quot; from the company whose credit  card you used to purchase tickets from the Site. Should you do so, your tickets  may be cancelled, and the Company may, in its sole discretion, refuse to honor  pending and future ticket purchases made from all credit card accounts or  online accounts on which such chargebacks have been made, and may prohibit all  persons in whose name the credit card accounts exist and any person who  accesses any associated online account or credit card or who otherwise breaches  this provision from using the Site.</p>
    <p>If a refund is issued, it will be  issued using the same method of payment that was used to purchase the tickets.  If a credit card was used to make the refunded purchase, then only that actual  credit card will receive the credit for the refund. The Company will not be  liable for travel or any other expenses that you or anyone else incurs in  connection with a cancelled or postponed event.</p>
    <p><strong>11. Billing  Information Verification</strong></p>
    <p>Orders are processed only after a  billing address, and other billing information, has been verified.  Occasionally, we receive incorrect billing or credit card account information  for a ticket order that can delay processing and delivery. In these cases, the  Company customer service will attempt to contact you, using the information  provided at the time of purchase. If the Company is unable to reach you after  its initial attempt, the Company may cancel your order and may sell your  tickets to another customer without further notice.</p>

    <p><strong>12. Delivery</strong></p>
    <p>Once a purchase transaction is made on nuqat.me, you should receive a  confirmation email which is considered as an e-ticket. You&rsquo;ll need to print it  out and bring it with you to the event in order to receive your event pass.</p>
    <p><strong>13. Pricing and Other Errors</strong></p>
    <p>If the amount you pay for a ticket is incorrect regardless of whether  because of an error in a price posted on this website or otherwise communicated  to you, or you are able to order a ticket before its scheduled on-sale or  presale date or you are able to order a ticket that was not supposed to have  been released for sale, then the Company will have the right to cancel that  ticket (or the order for that ticket) and refund to you the amount that you  paid. This will apply regardless of whether because of human error or a  transactional malfunction of this website or other Company operated system.</p>
    <p>Prices include VAT for Lebanese  citizens. </p>
    <p><strong>14. Multiple Browser Windows</strong></p>
    <p>When ordering tickets online with nuqat.me, please ensure you are  looking for tickets and placing an order using only one browser window. Looking  up tickets using multiple browser windows could result in losing your tickets  or timer expiration.</p>
    <p><strong>15. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
    <p>You voluntarily assume all risks and danger incidental to the event for  which the ticket is issued, whether occurring before, during or after the  event, and you waive any claims for personal injury or death against the  Company, management, facility, artist, participants, and all of their  respective parents, affiliated entities, agents, officers, directors, owners  and employees on behalf of yourself and any accompanying minor. You bear all  risks of inclement weather. Event date and time are subject to change.</p>
    <p><strong>16. License; Ejection and Cancellation; No Redemption Value</strong></p>
    <p>The Company reserve the right, without refund of any amount paid, to  refuse admission to, or eject, any person whose conduct management deems  disorderly, who uses vulgar or abusive language or who fails to comply with the  event rules. Breach of terms or rules will terminate your license to attend the  event without refund. A ticket is a revocable license and admission may be  refused upon refunding the ticket's face amount. A ticket is not redeemable for  cash.</p>
    <p><strong>17. Recording, Transmission and Exhibition</strong></p>
    <p>You agree not to record or transmit, or  aid in recording or transmitting, any description, account, picture, or  reproduction of the event. You agree that the event for which you purchase  tickets is a public event, that your appearance and actions inside and outside  the venue where the event occurs are public in nature, and that you have no  expectation of privacy with regard to your actions or conduct at the event. You  grant permission to the CompanyÂ  to  utilize your name, image, likeness, acts, poses, plays, appearance, movements,  and statements in any live or recorded audio, video, or photographic display or  other transmission, exhibition, publication or reproduction made of, or at, the  event (regardless of whether before, during or after play or performance) for  any purpose, in any manner, in any medium or context now known or hereafter  developed, without further authorization from, or compensation to, you or  anyone acting on your behalf.</p>
    <p><strong>18. You Are Subject to Search</strong></p>
    <p>You and your belongings may be searched on entry to the event. You  consent to such searches and waive any related claims that may arise. If you  elect not to consent to such searches, you may be denied entry to the event  without refund or other compensation. Under certain facility rules, certain items  may not be brought into the premises, including without limitation, alcohol,  drugs, controlled substances, cameras, recording devices, laser pointers,  strobe lights, irritants (e.g., artificial noisemakers), bundles and  containers.</p>
    <p><strong>19. Unlawful Re-Sale of Tickets; Commercial Purposes</strong></p>
    <p>Unlawful resale (or attempted resale), counterfeit or copy of tickets is  grounds for seizure and cancellation without compensation. In addition, the  Company reserves the right to restrict or deny ticket purchasing privileges to  anyone that the Company determines to be, or has been, in violation of this  policy. Because the Company does not guarantee the authenticity of tickets  purchased from any non-authorized third party reseller (such as brokers or  individuals), the Company recommends that you purchase tickets directly through  nuqat.me, authorized partners or from the venue box office to ensure ticket  authenticity. Tickets may not be used for advertising, promotions, contests or  sweepstakes, unless formal written authorization is given by the Company,  provided that even if such consent is obtained, any use of the Company&rsquo;s  trademarks and other intellectual property is subject to the Company's consent.</p>
